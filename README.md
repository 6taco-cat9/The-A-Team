# The-A-Team - element wordle

**progress -> PROGRESS.md**

**data_file -> english_words.txt, elemental_words.txt**

**python prep -> dictionary_search.py, backend(b4).py**

**main python and gui -> letter_state.py, play_wordle.py, wordle.py**

dictionary_search.py reads the english words from english_words.txt, select words which can be constructed from elements' symbols, and write them in elemental_words.txt

backend(b4).py contains some functions such as formatting the words from elemental_words.txt, and fiding max steps required to get a chosen wordle from first input (which we didn't end up using as it adds extra, extra complexities for the user)
